## Create flowchart and pseudocode for the following:
//1.Input a year and find whether it is a leap year or not. 
1. input a year.
2. check whether it is divisble by 4 and 100.
3. if yes then go to step 5.
4. if not ,go to step 6.
5. Print "entered year is a leap year".
6. Print "entered year is not a leap year".
7. end.
//2. Take two numbers and print the sum of both.
1. Input two numbers a and b.
2. take another variable sum.
3. store the sum of a and b in variable sum.(sum=a+b)
4. Print the sum.
5. end.
//3. Take a number as input and print the multiplication table for it.
1. input a number.
2. run a loop from counter=1 to counter=10.
3. inside loop print the input number *counter variable.
4. end.
//4. Take 2 numbers as inputs and find their HCF and LCM.
1. input two numbers num1,num2.
2. check num1>num2 till num1==num2,if the condition is true then do num1=num1-num2.
3. if num1>num2 is false then do num2=num2-num1 till num1==num2.
4. Print num1.
//5. Keep taking numbers as inputs till the user enters â€˜xâ€™, after that print sum of all.
1. input a number say num1.
2. take a variable sum=0;
3. do sum=sum+counter while (num1!=x).
4. Print sum.
5. end.
6.
